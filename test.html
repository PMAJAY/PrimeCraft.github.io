    <h3>How analogue sound can be represented in digital form</h3>
    <p style>Before we start you need to know the difference between analogue and digital sound. Analogue sound is continuous signal of vibrations that move the air molecules and transmit a continuous acoustic wave. Digital sound is where we use technology to record, store and alter analogue signals into digital form.</p>
    <p>Once we havecaptured sounds using a microphone we can draw a graph of a soundwave and split it up into smaller, regular time intervals to become a series of samples. This will allow us to measure the amplitudes and obtain a sample rate that can be converted to binary and during the quantisation stage by mapping these samples to a band and giving that band a number.</p>
